Project Overview:

This project involves creating a login and sign-up system where users can register with a unique username and a secure password. The application ensures that each userâ€™s password is securely hashed before storing it in the MongoDB database. The application also verifies that the username is unique; if a user attempts to register with an already existing username, the system will notify them and prompt them to choose another one.

Technologies Used:

Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB (with Mongoose)
bcrypt (for password hashing)
EJS (for dynamic view rendering)
